# FOR THE ONE 
  It has three pages Home,Flower,and Cart , it is flower selling website with two media queries for large and small devices.
  the project is yet to be completed but for now I have included the needed requirements,
    please note that I have made the buttons "order" on "flower page" using java script to capture the value of " title , price , description " of the flowers but unfortunately I ran out of time.

  Features included:
1. Css flex box for flower gallery photo display and  two css grid 4 columns for the footer 
   and the flower page hero content.
2. Css animation display for the logo and the welcome message on the home page .
3. created button for hide/show "flower photo gallery" div element using java script.
4. created a form and validated one field "email" using java script.
